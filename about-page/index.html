        <h1><u>History</u></h1>
        <h3>It originated in 1916 as Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke, a builder of aircraft engines, but assumed the name
            Bayerische Motoren Werke in July 1917 and began producing motorcycles in the 1920s. BMW entered the
            automobile business in 1928. The company’s R32 motorcycle set a world speed record that was not broken until
            1937. During World War II BMW built the world’s first jet airplane engines, used by the Luftwaffe, Germany’s
            air force. After the war the company tried to move into the small-car market but found that it could not
            compete effectively against Volkswagen’s compact, inexpensive autos. By 1959 the company was on the verge of
            bankruptcy, and its managers were planning to sell the firm to Daimler-Benz.</h3>

        <h1><u>BMW AND SUSTAINABILITY</u></h1>
        <h3>The BMW Group is continuing to design the future and is constantly driving sustainability forwards with its
            innovations. The circular economy is the key to conserving resources and reducing carbon emissions. For us,
            circularity in particular means that at the end of their use phase, vehicles are used as a source of raw
            materials for new cars.

            Our vehicles are already made from up to 30 per cent recycled and reused materials on average. We would like
            to continue increasing this amount. Fundamental research, detailed development and a clear focus on
            sustainability are employed to investigate each production process and find alternative raw materials. We
            are concentrating on raw materials that are procured in a responsible way, processed carbon-free or at least
            low in carbon and highly recyclable. In our search for innovative solutions, we adopt new perspectives and
            rethink conventional approaches. Our aspiration and our promise: we turn things around.</h3>
